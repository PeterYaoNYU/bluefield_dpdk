# bluefield_dpdk
## A High Performance Network Library for Nvidia Bluefield-2 DPU
## Failure Detection with DPDK
- [x] Devinfo 
  - check if ports are binded to DPDK successfully, get binded port info
- [x] Send_recv 
  - for two nodes in a LAN, send and receive packets, serve as a skeleton for future applications
- [x] Chen's Failure Detector
  - I just need a safety margin and it will be good to go


- [ ] Profiling the Chen's failure detector between two nodes
- [x] A basic LSTM model using C++ LibTorch, which trains a given batch of input
    
- [ ] A basic LSTM model using C++ LibTorch, which trains as it goes

- [ ] A failure detector using LSTM, using DPDK and libtorch
